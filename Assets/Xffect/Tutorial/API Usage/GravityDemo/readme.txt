This demo demonstrated some advantage uses of Xffect Editor:

*************************Gravity Modifier*****************
you can set the 'Gravity Object' at run time, and together with 'Collision Config' to make a nice missile effect.

*************************Multiple Modifier Cooperate *****************
please check out the 'soul' EffectLayer, it has 3 modifiers: 'Gravity', 'Acceleration' and 'Turbulence'. 
Their magnitude is controlled by curve, so we can disable 'Gravity' force at time [0s - 0.7s], then active it immediately to attract all missiles to the target.
