
Please check the 'Parent Emitter' Xffect:
1, We must use a 'XffectCache' to pool the sub emitters.
2, A 'Birth' sub emitter will be activated when a node is born.
3, A 'Collision' sub emitter will be activated when a node is collided.


NOTE:The parent emitter is a dummy layer, all the nodes' color is clear.
